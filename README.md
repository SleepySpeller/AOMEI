# AOMEI
Code for the Plugin used in TheThreadGames, coded by me
<br>
This plugin is used for the zombie infection in the battlegrounds on TheThreadGames
<br>
It took me some time to make it, but finally I got a prototype for people to test.
<br>
If you see any bugs please report them to me on Discord (SleepySpeller#0289) or E-Mail (support@slpy.ml)
<br>
#How to use the plugin?
You toggle the plugin using the command /aomei
<br>
By default the plugin is disabled.
<br>
When the plugin is enabled zombies have a 5% chance of infecting you, and will infect you if you have less that 5 hearts!
<br>
To cure yourself just eat an Golden Apple!
<br>
While you are infected you will get diffrent effects as time goes on

# Software used:
 - Intellij Community
 - Java 17 (duh its minecraft JAVA)
 - Bukkit API
